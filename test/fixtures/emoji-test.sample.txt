# Emoji Keyboard/Display Test Data for UTS #51
# Version: 16.0
#
# For documentation and usage, see https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51
#
# This file provides data for testing which emoji forms should be in keyboards and which should also be displayed/processed.
# Format: code points; status # emoji name
#     Code points — list of one or more hex code points, separated by spaces
#     Status
#       component           — an Emoji_Component,
#                             excluding Regional_Indicators, ASCII, and non-Emoji.
#       fully-qualified     — a fully-qualified emoji (see ED-18 in UTS #51),
#                             excluding Emoji_Component
#       minimally-qualified — a minimally-qualified emoji (see ED-18a in UTS #51)
#       unqualified         — a unqualified emoji (See ED-19 in UTS #51)
# Notes:
#   • This includes the emoji components that need emoji presentation (skin tone and hair)
#     when isolated, but omits the components that need not have an emoji
#     presentation when isolated.
#   • The RGI set is covered by the listed fully-qualified emoji. 
#   • The listed minimally-qualified and unqualified cover all cases where an
#     element of the RGI set is missing one or more emoji presentation selectors.
#   • The file is in CLDR order, not codepoint order. This is recommended (but not required!) for keyboard palettes.
#   • The groups and subgroups are illustrative. See the Emoji Order chart for more information.
